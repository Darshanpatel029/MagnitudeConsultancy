                      Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom or the UK,
                      is a sovereign state located off the northwestern coast
                      of mainland Europe. It comprises four neighboring island
                      countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
                      Ireland.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Although England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
                      are “nations”, they are not officially independent
                      countries. Instead, they are part of the country of the
                      United Kingdom (UK)—and bound by the UK constitution.
                      Each of the four UK countries has local governments,
                      which manage local affairs, such as healthcare and other
                      social services. A democratically-elected UK government
                      oversees all national and international affairs,
                      including student visas and other education related
                      regulations.

                        The capital city, and the largest city of the UK, is
                      London. It is also the capital of England. The capital
                      of Scotland, Wales and Northern Island are Edinburgh,
                      Cardiff, and Belfast respectively. The population of the
                      UK is 67.7 million people (2019 estimate). The UK is a
                      highly multicultural country, made up of people from
                      many different cultural and religious backgrounds. In
                      fact, nearly 15% of the residents identify themselves as
                      an ethnic minority.

                          seaboard of Europe. Since the UK is always in or
                          close to the path of the polar front jet stream,
                          frequent changes in pressure and unsettled weather
                          are typical. Many types of weather can be
                          experienced in a single day. In general the climate
                          of the UK is cool and often cloudy and rainy, and
                          high temperatures are infrequent.</p>

                            If the air masses are strong enough in their respective areas during the summer, there can sometimes be a large difference in temperature between the far north of Scotland (including its islands) and the south-east of England – often a difference of 10-15 °C (18-27 °F) but sometimes as much as 20 °C (36 °F) or more. In the height of summer the Northern Isles can have temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F), while Cambridge in the East of England, on 25 July 2019, reached 38.7 °C

                        <b>3. Opportunities offered by UK education system</b>
                        <p>
                          Among the benefits of studying in UK is a wide choice in picking your field of study and
                          institution. You can choose from 150,000 courses at universities and colleges across England,
                          Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and directly contact the institute to order prospectuses.
                        </p>
                        <p>You may find the one-year duration for all Master’s programmes to be a big advantage.
                          Alternatively, you may opt for a Master’s programme in combination with PhD, which will save you
                          an additional year. Shorter duration of courses in UK helps reduce tuition and accommodation
                          costs.</p>

                        <b>4. Supportive and Friendly</b>
                        <p>
                          The UK education system promotes close interaction between students and lecturers and provides
                          the freedom to combine different subjects into a single course of study. English language
                          support is offered by many institutions to help international students develop the essential
                          study and language skills required to complete their course successfully. Most universities have
                          counsellors and advisors to provide information and support to international students who can
                          help you get used to the education system or any aspect of your course.

                        <b>6. Health benefits</b>
                        <p>
                          Indian students in the UK are eligible to receive free medical treatment by the National Health
                          Service (NHS) if enrolled in a full-time course. Your spouse/partner and/or dependent children
                          will also be exempt from payment if they reside with you during the course of your study
                          programme. Your college or university may have a special health policy for students too.
                        </p>

                        <b>7. Cross-cultural experience</b>
                        <p>
                          There were 4,36,585 international students from 180+ countries studying in the UK last year, out
                          of which Indian students were the 2nd largest group (18,320)! Studying in UK is an opportunity
                          to experience a multicultural environment, meet new people and fellow international students
                          from across the world and discover new places. You benefit by developing a range of skills that
                          are necessary to be part of today’s global workforce.

                      The UK education system is divided into primary education (up to Year 6), secondary education
                      (Year 7-11), pre-university or further education (Year 12-13), and higher education consisting
                      of undergraduate and postgraduate studies. Since each of the UK countries have autonomy over
                      educational issues, there are some minor differences in the education system in different parts
                      of the UK.

                        Students begin their education at age 4, and typically graduate at age 16 with a General
                        Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE). GCSE is earned once students complete a set of
                        standardized exams for their chosen subjects at the end of Year 11.

                        students in the UK. Over 90% of British students study at state schools, which is governed and
                        funded by the UK Department of Education, and are free to attend. Students can also study at fee
                        levying independent schools. These schools are not administered by the government, but must

                        referred to Year 12 and Year 13 of their education journey. Students can choose to attain
                        academic qualifications which are required for admission into a university, or pursue vocational
                        qualifications to go directly into the workforce. Admission is based on one’s GCSE scores.
